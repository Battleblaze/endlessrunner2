## Gameplay
EndlessRunner is a 2-player multiplayer game where the goal is to survive for as long as possible by running and jumping over obstacles. Both players share the same health bar, and if both players manage to clear a section without losing health, the next section will be obstacle-free. The game difficulty increases as you progress, making it more challenging for players to survive.

- The game can be played using the keyboard.

## Scoring System
The game features a score system where players can earn points by avoiding obstacles and surviving as long as possible. The top three high scores are saved in the game, providing players with a target to beat their previous scores.

## Saving High Scores
EndlessRunner automatically saves the top three high scores, so players can easily track their progress and try to beat their previous scores.
